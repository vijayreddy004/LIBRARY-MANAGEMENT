# LIBRARY-MANAGEMENT

A full-stack **Library Management** system — frontend + backend — that lets users browse a catalog, view book details, borrow/return books, and (optionally) perform admin CRUD operations on books and users.

This README is a complete, copy-ready template you can paste into the repository root. Where I wasn’t certain about exact frameworks, ports or script names I left clear `TODO` placeholders you should replace with the real values from your code (for example `package.json`, server entry, or DB config).

# Project overview

`LIBRARY-MANAGEMENT` is a simple full-stack application to manage a library catalog and basic borrowing workflow. The project separates the UI (frontend) and server/API (backend) so you can run and deploy them independently.

Use this repo to experiment with building CRUD apps, authentication, REST APIs, and client-server integration.

---

# Features

* Browse/search books by title, author, ISBN or tags
* View book details (description, copies available, status)
* Borrow / return books (with simple availability checks)
* Admin actions: add / edit / delete books (if backend supports roles)
* Local export or save (JSON) and optional server persistence
* Responsive UI for desktop and mobile

*If your implementation has additional features (user accounts, image uploads, role-based auth, scheduled fines, email notifications), add them to this list.*

---

# Tech stack

> Replace any items below with the exact frameworks used in your repo.

* Frontend: React / Vite / Create React App (or plain HTML/CSS/JS)
* Backend: Node.js + Express (or Flask / Django / Spring Boot)
* Database: MongoDB / PostgreSQL / SQLite (or file-based JSON for demo)
* Optional: JWT for auth, bcrypt for password hashing, Axios/fetch for HTTP

├─ backend/          # Backend API (server)
├─ README.md         # <-- you are here

*(If your repo differs, update the structure section to match the actual layout.)*

---

# Getting started (local)

## Prerequisites

* Node.js (v14+ recommended) and npm or yarn
* If using a DB server: MongoDB / Postgres installed or accessible remotely

## Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vijayreddy004/LIBRARY-MANAGEMENT.git
cd LIBRARY-MANAGEMENT
```

## Run backend

```bash
cd backend
# install
npm install

# development
npm run dev      # or `npm start` depending on package.json
```

Expected behavior: backend will start on a port (e.g. `3000` or `5000`). If your server uses a different command or port, update the command above.

## Run frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install

# development
npm start        # or `npm run dev` depending on package.json
```

Open the UI at `http://localhost:3000` or the port printed by your dev server (Vite commonly uses `5173`).

---

# Environment variables

Create `.env` files in `backend/` and `frontend/` as needed.

### Backend `.env` (example)

```
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/librarydb
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Frontend `.env` (example — depends on your setup)

For Create React App:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

For Vite:

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

Make sure the frontend API base URL matches the backend port.

---

# API (example)

Below are suggested REST endpoints — update to reflect your actual backend routes.

**Books**

* `GET /api/books` — list books (supports query params for search/pagination)
* `GET /api/books/:id` — get book details
* `POST /api/books` — create a new book (admin)
* `PUT /api/books/:id` — update a book (admin)
* `DELETE /api/books/:id` — delete a book (admin)

**Borrowing**

* `POST /api/borrow` — borrow a book (body: userId, bookId)
* `POST /api/return` — return a book (body: userId, bookId)

**Auth (if present)**

* `POST /api/auth/register` — register user
* `POST /api/auth/login` — login -> returns JWT

*Adjust endpoints and payloads to match your backend implementation.*

---

# Database / Persistence

* Development: you may use a local MongoDB / PostgreSQL instance, or a JSON file for quick demos.
* Production: use managed DB services (MongoDB Atlas, AWS RDS, ElephantSQL) and secure DB credentials using env vars.

If your backend uses migrations or seed scripts, document the commands (example):

```bash
# run migrations / seed data
npm run migrate
npm run seed
```

---

# Build & deploy

## Frontend (production build)

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
# output: build/ (CRA) or dist/ (Vite)
```

Deploy the static build to Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or any static host.

## Backend (production)

* Deploy to Render, Heroku, Railway, DigitalOcean App Platform, or a VPS.
* Use process managers (PM2) or containerize with Docker.

## Docker (optional)

Consider adding `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to run backend + frontend + DB together.

---

# Testing

If tests exist, include commands here. Example:

```bash
# backend tests
cd backend
npm test

# frontend tests
cd frontend
npm test
```

Add unit/integration tests for API endpoints and key frontend components where possible.

---

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Suggested workflow:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`
3. Commit with a descriptive message: `git commit -m "feat: add search by author"`
4. Push and open a Pull Request.

Please include:

* Clear description of changes and motivation
* Screenshots or short GIF for UI changes
* Any new env vars or setup instructions
